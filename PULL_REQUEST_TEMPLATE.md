#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Anwar followed Sarah Joy's lab, then worked independently after lunch. It took about 2.5 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on creating a form in new.html
  2. Next, we prepared our HTML template for handlebars compatibility in our head
  3. Third, we called the articleView.initNewArticlePage(); function at the bottom of new.html
  4. Then, we worked on articleView.js. Hiding and revealing appropriate content, instantiating an article based on form field input, output new article and JSON into the DOM.
  5. During individual time, I styled the JSON feed in layout.css
  6. Then I highlighted the JSON using highlight JS, one of the stretch goals.
